# free-toilet-near-me

## Description 

This is a repository for a web application temporarily called FreeToiletNearMe, 
it is meant to solve a common issue of not knowing where the closest free toilet is.

## How it works? 

Map with pins on locations of toilets with short information and description will be shown to
users after inputting their location or when their location is found with GPS on their device.
Every user will be able to review the toilet with star system and create new pins for all 
users to see. It is also planned to add more categories of toilets for instance paid toilets
but with information on price, cleanliness etc. User after visiting the toilet will be asked to 
review accuracy of location, information on price, description etc.
